## Java 8 Specific Programs

This folder contains programs specifically written for **Java 8**.
These examples showcase the powerful features introduced in Java 8, including:

- **Lambda Expressions**: Simplify your code with concise functional-style programming.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Use interfaces with a single abstract method for lambda expressions.
- **Streams API**: Process collections of data in a functional way.
- **Default Methods in Interfaces**: Enhance interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
- **Optional Class**: Avoid null pointer exceptions with a more robust handling of optional values.
- **New Date and Time API**: Handle dates and times more effectively with `java.time`.
- **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: Integrate Java with JavaScript seamlessly.

These programs leverage Java 8-specific functionality and may not be compatible with earlier versions of Java. To get the most out of these examples, make sure you are using **Java 8** or later.
